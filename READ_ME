### Human User Guide for @helloitsjacob

_What is this? A Human User Guide or Personal Operating Manual is a portable, always up-to-date document meant to describe a Hubber’s work style. It is meant to be shared with your coworkers and updated as you learn more about yourself. Here is mine._ 

Hi :wave:! I’m Jacob (handle: @hellotsijacob). I joined GitHub in 2024 as a Program Manager for the Office of the COO. I bring a breadth of experience across strategy, finance, and operations for Fortune500 and start-ups a-like. You can typically find me trying to improve or automate processes, developing business cases, and bringing ideas and strategy to life through the lens of people and analysis.
  
### My working and communications style:
- I have a preference for async communication where possible, but I love collaborating together when it makes sense
- Bringing solutions and analytics to the conversation will help me align what were doing today with where we want to go tomorrow
- I work on a flexible schedule and across a number of time zones. I send (or schedule messages) for when they work best for me (or I believe will work best for you!), but feel free to respond at a time that is convienent for you.
- I love to hear and debate new ideas, theories, challenges, and opportunities. - I'm always open to new ideas, even if I may play devil's advocate at times.
- I tend to start out quiet, observant, & with listening in mind but then I move more and more into extroverted moments where I can add value.
                                                                                                                            
- I have an itch to solve 🔧⛑ and get things moving when they get stagnant  - I love bringing people together, bridging gaps and helping people positively move forward 
- I believe in the power of building partnerships 🤝 🙃genuine positive collaborative relationships. So I genuinely appreciate one on one interactions
- I thrive when empowered 💪 🙂 and trusted to do my job - I'll always communicate and keep people in the loop. Clipping my wings is cryptonite for my creativity and enthusiasm 
- I'm both an extrovert and introvert 🌗 - I love connecting, socializing, and making things happen. But I also need to disconnect to recharge 🔌-  So if I don't have pressing deadlines, I like to disconnect from my 📞 and 💻 at night. 

### What I value:
- The Benefit of the doubt & compassion - missunderstandings can happen 😵‍💫, especially in a mulitcuiltural-global 🌎 setting
- Accountability - taking 100% responsibility for agreed upon deliverables and delivering on time 
- Partnership and collaboration - let's make things happen! I'll have your back, you have mine! we'll help each other in any way we can
- Can do attitude and openness - There is more than one way to arrive at the same result, let's find a way 🤗
- Meaning/purpose - finding ways to impact someone's life while increasing the bottom line
- Sense of humor - we spend all day at work, let's work hard but have fun 🙃 and respectfully joke


### What I don’t have patience for:
- Pointing fingers - let's focus on the solution first 🙂 and then let's figure out kindly what happened and how we can learn from it
- Lack of accountability and cooperation - the team counts on everyone to deliver on their tasks and solve for issues on their court
- Overcomplicating things - appreciate keeping things simple, easy to follow and understand and reducing unnecesary complex vocabulary, steps, documents or red tape 


### How to communicate with me and help me help you!
- Communicate! Communicate! Communicate! - I enjoy brainstorming sessions, 1:1, or slack - give me a heads up, I'll do the same. Raise your concerns, if you worry a deliverable may end up being late, etc. I like an open door policy 😊 and anyone can reach out and ping me or call me at any time
- I'm Latin! I'm very expressive with my hands, face, eyes and tone 🙅🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️. Kindly give me the benefit of the doubt and/or clarify with me if something seems 🤨 odd  
- Clarity - I appreciate knowing who, the target and by when you'll deliver or want me to deliver

### Other personal details (so we get to know each other as humans!)
- I love animals and The love of my life is a 15 year old malteepoo 🐶 doggy! he is the funniest, sweetest and silliest adorable furr ball - We've been together through it all!   
- I love reading, writing, journaling, podcasts - I'm into personal growth and spiritual subjects. Fascinated with life after death, aliens and reincarnation 🤷🏻‍♀️. 
- I love good feeling and funny movies -  love musicals and technicolor true classics from the 40's and 50's - refuse to watch anything with violence in it or anything scary - Life is scary enough at times - Laughter is the best medicine
