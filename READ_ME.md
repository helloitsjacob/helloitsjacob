### Human User Guide for @helloitsjacob

_What is this? A Human User Guide or Personal Operating Manual is a portable, always up-to-date document meant to describe a Hubber’s work style. It is meant to be shared with your coworkers and updated as you learn more about yourself. Here is mine._ 

Hi :wave:! I’m Jacob (handle: @hellotsijacob). I joined GitHub in 2024 as a Program Manager for the Office of the COO. I bring a breadth of experience across strategy, finance, and operations for Fortune500 and start-ups a-like. You can typically find me trying to improve or automate processes, developing business cases, and bringing ideas and strategy to life through the lens of people and analysis.
  
### My working and communications style:
- I have a preference for async communication where possible, but I love collaborating together when it makes sense
- Bringing solutions and analytics data to the conversation will help me align what were doing today with where we want to go tomorrow
- I work on a flexible schedule and across a number of time zones. I send (or schedule messages) for when they work best for me (or I believe will work best for you!), but feel free to respond at a time that is convienent for you. I tend to not be looking at my I like to disconnect from my 📞 and 💻 before or after shoulder hours. 
- I love to hear and debate new ideas, theories, challenges, and opportunities. - I'm always open to new ideas, even if I may play devil's advocate 😅 at times.
- 😶 I tend to start out quiet, observant, & with listening in mind but then I move more and more into extroverted moments where I can add value.
                                                                                                                            

### What I value:
- Trust, 🤝 given, received, and earned
- Assuming positive intent
- Execution
- Treating each other as humans (and developing processes that back that up!)
- Small or big wins! Finding new ways, new ideas, and new processes to improve the way we (you, me, github, everyone) operates!
- Transparency
- Feedback


### What I don’t have patience for:
- Long drawn out processes or rhythms that could (and should) be automated or removed
- Interrupting one another
- Causing chaos for chaos-sake


### How to communicate with me and help me help you!
- Communicate! Typically, I'm not a mind-reader or I may forget what you mentioned off-hand. A ping, gentle reminder, a task, or issue can help me execute what you might need!
- If you have questions, ask! I'll try to find the answer if I can
- I'm always open for a quick sync or async chat! Nothing is off the cards and there aren't (too many) stupid questions.
- If there is written documentation, please provide it!

### Other personal details (so we get to know each other as humans!)
- My five year-old Vizsla pup will probably join many of our calls (her name is Kaia)! 🐕
- I love cooking! Pass along any recipes you might have!
- I roast my own coffee, hmu if you'd like some! ☕
- I typically can be found excercising or outside as much as possible. It could be hiking, swimming, biking, yoga, or a quick work-out class 🥾 🚲 🏊
- Utah and Hawaii are my go-to happy places
- I love chatting about food, resteraunts, coffee, hiking, traveling, strategy, dogs, books, photography, and pretty much any daily news topics including future-of-work, investments, or the latest Netflix series 🍕 💰 📷
